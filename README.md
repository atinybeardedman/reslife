This application provides accountability functionality for boarding schools to keep track of students. This repository does not currently contain a fully functioning application as of yet, as I am rewriting existing functionality that was written for a particular school to become more generalized. Once this process is complete I will update this readme to include more information including a live demo, as well as instructions for building and testing locally.
