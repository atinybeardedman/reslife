  Creating a New Year? Here are a few things to remember:
  <ul>
    <li>
      All dates in the application are inclusive. Your start and end dates
      should reflect days when the dorm is open and you expect to check students
      in. Breaks are also inclusive, so start and end dates of breaks should be
      days when no check-ins will conducted.
    </li>
    <li>
      After creating the academic year, you should be sure to do the following
      tasks in order:
      <ol>
        <li>Update the dorms (setting active, inactive, or adding more)</li>
        <li>
          Create a new regular schedule for the new year (the old does not roll
          over)
        </li>
        <li>
          Add/Update Boarders. If you want boarders to roll over, edit them and
          extend their end date to the end of this year. If you do not do this,
          they will not roll over automatically and you do not have to worry
          about them.
        </li>
        <li>Update your staff list</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
